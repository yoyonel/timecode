0.2.0
=====

* **New:** Rewritten the whole library from scratch.

* **New:** Most important change is the licencing. There was now license
  defined in the previous implementation. The library is now licensed under MIT
  license.

* **Update:** Timecode.__init__() arguments has been changed, removed the
  unnecessary ``drop_frame``, ``iter_returns`` arguments.
  
  Drop frame can be interpreted from the ``framerate`` argument and
  ``iter_returns`` is unnecessary cause any iteration on the object will return
  another ``Timecode`` instance.

  If you want to get a string representation use ``Timecode.__str__()`` or
  ``str(Timecode)`` or ``Timecode.__repr__()`` or ``\`Timecode\``` or
  ``'%s' % Timecode`` any other thing that will convert it to a string.

  If you want to get an integer use ``Timecode.frames`` or
  ``Timecode.frame_count`` depending on what you want to get out of it.

  So setting the ``iter_returns`` to something and nailing the output was
  unnecessary.

* **Update:** Updated the drop frame calculation to a much better one, which
  is based on to the blog post of David Heidelberger at
  http://www.davidheidelberger.com/blog/?p=29

* **New:** Added ``Timecode.__eq__()`` so it is now possible to check the
  equality of two timecode instances or a timecode and a string or a timecode
  and an integer (which will check the total frame count).

* **Update:** ``Timecode.tc_to_frames()`` now needs a timecode as a string
  and will return an integer value which is the number of frames in that
  timecode.

* **Update:** ``Timecode.frames_to_tc()`` now needs an integer frame count
  and returns 4 integers for hours, minutes, seconds and frames.

* **Update:** ``Timecode.hrs``, ``Timecode.mins``, ``Timecode.secs`` and
  ``Timecode.frs`` attributes are now properties. Because it was so rare to
  check the individual hours, minutes, seconds or frame values, their values
  are calculated with ``Timecode.frames_to_tc()`` method. But in future they
  can still be converted to attributes and their value will be updated each
  time the ``Timecode.frames`` attribute is changed (so add a ``_frames``
  attribute and make ``frames`` a property with a getter and setter, and update
  the hrs, mins, secs and frs in setter etc.).

* **Update:** Removed ``Timecode.calc_drop_frame()`` method. The drop frame
  calculation is neatly done inside ``Timecode.frames_to_tc()`` and
  ``Timecode.tc_to_frames()`` methods.

* **Update:** Updated ``Timecode.parse_timecode()`` method to a much simpler
  algorithm.

* **Update:** Removed ``Timecode.__return_item__()`` method. It is not
  necessary to return an item in that way anymore.

* **Update:** Removed ``Timecode.make_timecode()`` method. It was another
  unnecessary method, so it is removed. Now using simple python string
  templates for string representations.

* **New:** Added ``timecode.__version__`` string, and set the value to
  "0.2.0".

* **Update:** Removed ``Timecode.set_int_framerate()`` method. Setting the
  framerate will automatically set the ``Timecode.int_framerate`` attribute.
